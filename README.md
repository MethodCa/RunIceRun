# My first video game!!
RunIceRun was made with Unity 4.0 circa 2013; this project was part of a game jam at the UDES University in Cucuta, Colombia.

The first Game jam was a fantastic experience. The game jam was executed on a weekend, during which we taught the basics of game development, game design, 3D modelling, and animation. The last 12 hours were used for the game jam activity, and the theme was ice and speed.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a very crude and rushed version but was an excellent showcase of was could be done in little time and lots of enthusiasm.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app works in Windows only due to the deprecation of OpenGL in the OSX build.
